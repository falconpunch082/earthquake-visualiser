# earthquake-visualiser by falconpunch082 (Nicholas Dale)

Take a look at the website [here](https://falconpunch082.github.io/earthquake-visualiser/)!

This website dynamically displays earthquakes that occured for the past 7 days since accessing the website
thanks to the use of the [USGS Real-time Earthquake GeoJSON API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php).

The website also features the use of fraxen's [tectonicplates repository](https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/tree/master),
particularly the GeoJSON folder, to show the tectonic plates.

This work was originally made as part of the 2023-2024 Monash University Data Analytics Bootcamp. Link to the repository is
[here](https://github.com/falconpunch082/Data-Analysis-Portfolio).

Possible improvements include allowing the user to switch between earthquakes for the past week and past month, and providing more
information when clicking on a circle through an info page that pops out containing data from the API that is easy to understand.
